# Hacking on update-systemd-resolved

## Nix flake usage

This project supplies a [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix) file defining a Nix
flake.[^nix-flakes]

[^nix-flakes]: See the [NixOS wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) and the
               [`nix flake` page in the Nix package manager reference manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html)
               for background on Nix flakes.

This Nix flake defines three important important outputs:

1. A Nix package for `update-systemd-resolved` (see [here](./nix/packages.nix)),
2. A NixOS test of `update-systemd-resolved` features (see
   [here](./nix/checks.nix)), and
3. A Nix development shell[^devshell] (see [here](./nix/devshells.nix)).

[^devshell]: Based on the [`numtide/devshell`](https://github.com/numtide/devshell) project.

In order to work on the `update-systemd-resolved` project's Nix features,
you'll need to [install the Nix package
manager](https://nixos.org/download.html) and [ensure that the `flakes` and
`nix-command` experimental features are
enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes).

### Building the `update-systemd-resolved` package

To build the `update-systemd-resolved` package exposed by this flake, run the
following command:[^verbose-output]

[^verbose-output]: Note that the `-L` flag can be omitted for terser output.

```shell-session
$ nix build -L '.#'
```

Or:

```shell-session
$ nix build -L '.#update-systemd-resolved'
```

These two forms are functionally equivalent because the
`update-systemd-resolved` package is the default package.

In addition to building the package, `nix build` will place a symbolic link to
its output path at `./result` (`ls -lAR ./result/`, `tree ./result/`, or
similar to see what the package contains).

### Nix flake checks

This project includes a NixOS test of `update-systemd-resolved`'s functionality
and features, exposed as a Nix flake check.

Please see the NixOS manual's ["Testing with NixOS" section](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-nixos-tests)
for information on [writing](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-writing-nixos-tests)
and [calling](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-calling-nixos-tests)
NixOS tests, as well as information on [running them interactively](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-running-nixos-tests-interactively)
and [linking them to Nix packages](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-linking-nixos-tests-to-packages).

#### How the test works

This project's NixOS test sets up three machines:

1. An OpenVPN server,
2. An OpenVPN client,
3. A DNS resolver running an instance of
   [dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) bound only to the
   loopback address, plus an instance of
   [RouteDNS](https://github.com/folbricht/routedns) bound to an address
   reachable by the other machines.

The OpenVPN server and client run a [point-to-point configuration with a static
key](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/static-key-mini-howto/).  The
client's OpenVPN configuration file includes several instances of [the
`dhcp-option`s recognized by `update-systemd-resolved`](./README.md#usage).
The [test script](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#test-opt-testScript)
starts all three machines, waits for certain systemd services to become active,
and then asserts that certain hostnames are resolvable _from the client_ that
would not be resolvable unless the client were configured to use the DNS
settings specified in its OpenVPN configuration file.

The resolver machine uses dnsmasq for actual name resolution, plus DNSSEC
validation.  The RouteDNS instance running on the same machine terminates
DNS-over-TLS and forwards queries to dnsmasq.  Dnsmasq handles DNSSEC (though
we exempt the VPN domain from DNSSEC validation, as a test of the
`SetLinkDNSSECNegativeTrustAnchors` feature).

#### Extending the NixOS test

If you are implementing a new feature or correcting a bug in
`update-systemd-resolved`, you are encouraged to extend the NixOS test with new
test cases that exercise your feature or verify that the bug is fixed --
_unless_ you can adequately express these within the [unit test
suite](./README.md#how-to-help), as that suite runs significanly faster than
the NixOS test and has no prerequisites other than Bash.

#### Running Nix flake checks

To run the [above-mentioned](#nix-flake-usage) NixOS system test and other
checks,[^other-checks] execute the following command:[^verbose-output]

```shell-session
$ nix flake check -L
```

[^other-checks]: Other checks include linting the Nix source code in this
                 project, and running a syntax check on the polkit rules
                 generated by `update-systemd-resolved print-polkit-rules`.

##### Running a check for a specific system

Running `nix flake check [-L]` will execute Nix flake checks for all supported
systems.[^supported-systems]  To run a check for a particular system, instead
use the `nix build` command.  For instance, to execute the NixOS system test
for the `x86_64-linux` system, run:

```shell-session
$ nix build -L '.#checks.x86_64-linux.update-systemd-resolved'
```

[^supported-systems]: Run `nix flake show` to view flake outputs namespaced by
                      all supported systems.

#### Maintaining NixOS test assets

##### Regenerating the DNS-over-TLS keypair

To regenerate the keypair used for testing DNS-over-TLS, [enter the
devshell](#entering-the-nix-development-shell) and [run
`mkdotcert`](#summary-of-available-commands).

##### Regenerating the DNSSEC root anchors

To regenerate the dnsmasq root anchor specification used for testing DNSSEC,
[enter the devshell](#entering-the-nix-development-shell) and [run
`mkanchor`](#summary-of-available-commands).

### Entering the Nix development shell

To enter the Nix development shell, run the following command:

```shell-session
$ nix develop
```

You will be presented with a menu of commands available within the development
shell.
